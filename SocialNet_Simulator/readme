The objective of this assignment is to build SocialNet, a command-line simulator for a social network’s
 backend services. It implements functionalities for managing users, friendships, and content.
 The primary goal is to apply the concept of AVL Trees and Graphs to a complex, practical
 application.

How to run the file?
    - On WIndows, run get.bat file and type the commands
    - On Linux perform it on get.sh file


Files included:
1. header.cpp - Contains the AVL Tree, Node structure and imports the neccessary libraries used for storing posts in order.
2. code.cpp - Implements the SocialNet class with all main features like user handling, friends, posts, and suggestions.
3. main.cpp - Handles input commands and executes the corresponding actions.
4. input.txt - Sample input file.
5. readme.txt - About the file

Supported commands:

ADD_USER <username> Adds a new user to the network, initially with no friends and no posts.

ADD_FRIEND <username1> <username2> Establishesabidirectional friendship between two existing usernames.
LIST_FRIENDS <username> Prints an alphabetically sorted list of the specified username’s friends.
SUGGEST_FRIENDS <username> <N> Recommends up to N new friends who are ”friends of a friend”
 but not already friends.
 • Ranking: Recommendations are ranked by the number of mutual friends (descending). Ties are
 broken by alphabetical order of usernames.
 • Edge Cases: If N is 0, output nothing. If fewer than N candidates exist, list all available.

DEGREES_OF_SEPARATION <username1> <username2> Calculates the length of the shortest path of
 friendships between two usernames. If no path exists, reports-1.

ADD_POST <username> "<post content>" Add a post whose content is the postto the posts created by the specified user.
 content string,
OUTPUT_POSTS <username> <N> Output the most recent N posts of the user, in reverse chronological
 order. If N is-1, you should output all the posts by the user. If there are fewer than N posts by the user,
 then list all available posts.
 Note: Usernamesandpostcontentsarenotcase-sensitive. Forexample,theusernames Lakshay
 and lakshay are identical

Edge cases and how they’re handled:

1. Duplicate users:
   If a username already exists (even with different cases), the program prints a message like "user <name> exists".

2. Missing users:
   Any command involving a user that hasn’t been created yet prints "user <name> does not exist".

3. Empty usernames:
   Adding an empty username ("") doesn’t crash the program, though it’s not ideal. It’s still handled safely.

4. Self-friendship or duplicate friendships:
   If a user tries to friend themselves or re-add the same friend, the program detects it and avoids duplication.

5. Post handling:
   - If a user doesn’t exist, it prints an error.
   - Empty or blank posts are still accepted but don’t cause errors.
   - Asking for more posts than available prints all of them.
   - Using OUTPUT_POSTS with -1 shows every post.

6. Degrees of separation:
   - If the two users aren’t connected, it prints "No connection found."
   - If both names are the same, it shows 0.
   - Non-existent users are reported clearly.

7. Friend suggestions:
   - If a user has no friends, no suggestions are shown.
   - Suggestions are based on mutual friends and sorted by frequency.
   - If 0 suggestions are requested, nothing is printed.

P.S: 
All usernames are treated in lowercase to avoid case sensitivity issues. 
Posts are stored using an AVL Tree, ensuring they remain balanced and ordered. 
Each function checks inputs carefully so the program can handle invalid cases without crashing.

Example input:
ADD_USER Alice
ADD_USER Bob
ADD_FRIEND Alice Bob
ADD_POST Alice "Hello world!"
OUTPUT_POSTS Alice -1
END

Expected output:
posts:
hello world!

It can be further improved by implementing delete operations aswell
